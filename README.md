# Project 2: IMDB Movie Analysis Dashboard

For this project, our team chose an IMDB Movie Dataset from Kaggle to work with. We cleaned the data using Pandas in a Jupyter notebook, created a new CSV and loaded it into MongoDB. We, then, scraped a website to get the top ten  movies by gross revenue and plotted a bar graph and table. We used the OMDB API to receive the rankings of movies in the USA from 2012-2021. We graphed three charts using Plotly. Our last page is a map using LeafLet showing markers of movie production in each country.
